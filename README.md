# CryptoTradingPlatform
An open ended platform to trade cryptocurrencies 

This application creates a platform for people to trade on cryptocurrency markets using a variety of different strategies or triggering mechanisms. 
Instead of a normal cryptocurrency platform (like gekko) where a strategy is implemented to use platform provided information, this
framework allows for more open endedness. For example, implemented currently are a telegram listener and a gmail listener (for interpreting Trading View emails). 
In addition, this application has a framework to interract with markets, and is setup so that it isnt hard to implement a new market. 
Currently, we aim to have bitmex and 3commas implemented. 

This is a work in progress, and this readme will be updated.
